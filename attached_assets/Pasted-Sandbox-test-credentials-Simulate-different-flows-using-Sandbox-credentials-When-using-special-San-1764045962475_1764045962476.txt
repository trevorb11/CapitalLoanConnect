Sandbox test credentials
Simulate different flows using Sandbox credentials
When using special Sandbox test credentials described on this page (other than user_good / pass_good), use the /sandbox/public_token/create flow or a non-OAuth test institution, such as First Platypus Bank (ins_109508). Special test credentials may be ignored when using the Sandbox Link OAuth flow.

Sandbox simple test credentials
Use the username user_good and password pass_good.

These provide basic account access to most Plaid products. Certain Plaid products also have specialized credentials that can be used for more advanced testing or for getting more useful and realistic testing data. These specialized credentials can be found below.

Transactions testing credentials
Use the username user_transactions_dynamic and any password. For persona-based testing, use user_ewa_user, user_yuppie, or user_small_business.

These credentials have realistic transaction history and may update transactions and fire webhooks when /transactions/refresh is called. For more details, including information on how often new transactions are triggered or how to add your own custom transactions, see Testing Transactions in Sandbox and testing pending and posted transactions.

Auth micro-deposit testing credentials
Use the username user_good and the password microdeposits_good.

For more details, see Institution details for Auth testing.

Credit and Income testing credentials
Plaid provides a variety of pre-populated test users designed for use for Bank Income and other underwriting-related products.

Username	Password	Description
user_bank_income	{}	User with wide variety of income streams of different types
user_credit_bonus	Any	Has two salary streams: one with bonuses included in the paycheck, one with bonuses as separate transactions
user_credit_joint_account	Any	Has two salary streams and two identities on the account
user_credit_profile_poor	Any	Net loss cash flow over time, no consistent source of income
user_credit_profile_good	Any	Neutral cash flow over time, multiple gig economy income streams
user_credit_profile_excellent	Any	Positive cash flow over time, high salary-based income with secondary rental income stream
user_prism_1 through user_prism_8	Any	For testing Partner Insights reports, these users return a variety of consistent partner insights values
Plaid also provides a GitHub repo designed specifically for testing credit products; look in the income directory for credit-specific users. You can modify these users as you need. For instructions, see Custom users.

For details on testing Bank Income with custom data, see Testing Bank Income.

Monitor and Identity Verification testing users
Monitor and Identity Verification have product-specific Sandbox users that can be used for testing. For more details, see Testing Monitor and Testing Identity Verification.

Sandbox multi-factor credentials
You can trigger any multi-factor authentication (MFA) flow that Plaid supports when creating an Item by using username user_good and modifying the password.

Bank of America and U.S. Bank cannot be used as test institutions when triggering MFA flows with modified passwords. Instead, these banks will always launch on Sandbox with an MFA flow.

Multi-factor device OTP
MFA Device OTP credentials


username: 'user_good'
password: 'mfa_device'

# Code for all devices: 1234
code: 1234
Multi-factor questions
MFA Questions credentials


# n-rounds of m-questions per round, where 0 <= i, j < 9
username: 'user_good'
password: 'mfa_questions_<n>_<m>'

# answer_<i>_<j>, for j-th question in i-th round.
answer: 'answer_<i>_<j>'
Multi-factor selections
MFA selections credentials


username: 'user_good'
password: 'mfa_selections'

answer: 'Yes'
Multiple MFA selections credentials


# n-rounds of m-questions with o-answers per question
# 0 < n, m < 10 and 2 <= o < 10
username: 'user_good'
password: 'mfa_selections_<n>_<m>_<o>'

# answer_<n>_<m>_0, for m-th question in n-th round.
answer: 'answer_1_1_0'
ReCAPTCHA testing credentials
You may trigger a reCAPTCHA in Plaid Link in the Sandbox environment by customizing the test account password. Possible values are good or bad. A value of good will result in successful Item creation and bad will result in a RECAPTCHA_BAD error to simulate a failed reCAPTCHA. Both values require the reCAPTCHA to be manually solved within Plaid Link.

ReCAPTCHA


username: user_good
password: {"recaptcha":"bad"}
Error testing credentials
You can trigger several ITEM_ERROR or INSTITUTION_ERROR errors that you may encounter when creating an Item by using username user_good and modifying the password.

Error code password


error_[ERROR_CODE]
For example, the password error_ITEM_LOCKED allows you to simulate an ITEM_LOCKED error.

Note that error testing credentials are not compatible with institutions that use OAuth. If you are not sure whether an institution uses OAuth flows, see the list of Sandbox institutions to find an institution that is guaranteed not to use OAuth.

The list of errors that can be simulated in this way is below:



"COUNTRY_NOT_SUPPORTED"
"INSTITUTION_DOWN"
"INSTITUTION_NOT_RESPONDING"
"INSTITUTION_NO_LONGER_SUPPORTED"
"INSUFFICIENT_CREDENTIALS"
"INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"
"INVALID_CREDENTIALS"
"INVALID_MFA"
"INVALID_SEND_METHOD"
"ITEM_LOCKED"
"ITEM_NOT_SUPPORTED"
"MFA_NOT_SUPPORTED"
"NO_ACCOUNTS"
"PAYMENT_INVALID_RECIPIENT"
"USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT"
"USER_SETUP_REQUIRED"
You can test several other OAuth-specific Link errors via the drop-down selector on the First Platypus OAuth screen after selecting any OAuth institution. The list of errors that can be simulated in this way is below:



"INSUFFICIENT_CREDENTIALS"
"ACCESS_NOT_GRANTED"
"NO_AUTH_ACCOUNTS"
