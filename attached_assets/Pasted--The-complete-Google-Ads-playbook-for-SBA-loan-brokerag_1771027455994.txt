# The complete Google Ads playbook for SBA loan brokerages

**A $4,000/month budget can generate 20–35 qualified SBA loan leads monthly — if every dollar is deployed with surgical precision.** The SBA lending space on Google Ads is competitive but riddled with exploitable gaps: most advertisers run generic campaigns, ignore industry-specific keywords, and fail to build a coherent down-sell funnel. This report provides a complete, implementation-ready campaign blueprint — from keyword selection and ad copy through campaign architecture, bidding strategy, landing page design, and compliance — specifically engineered for a business funding brokerage connecting small businesses with SBA preferred lenders while capturing alternative financing revenue from non-qualifying leads.

At estimated CPCs of **$5–$15 for targeted SBA keywords**, your $4,000 budget yields roughly **400–700 clicks per month**. With an optimized landing page converting at **4–5.5%**, that translates to **20–35 leads at $115–$200 per lead**. Given that a single funded SBA deal generates **$5,000–$15,000+** in broker commission, even a 5–10% lead-to-close rate makes this channel highly profitable: 1–3 funded deals per month generating $5,000–$45,000 from $4,000 in ad spend.

## 1. Keyword clusters that balance volume, intent, and cost

The most critical strategic decision for a $4,000 budget is keyword selection. Broad terms like "business loan" ($15–$40 CPC) will burn through your budget in days. The winning strategy concentrates spend on **SBA-specific long-tail keywords** where intent is high and competition is manageable.

### Tier 1: Core SBA keywords (exact match, highest priority)

These are your bread-and-butter terms. They carry strong commercial intent but higher CPCs, so use exact match only.

| Keyword cluster | Top keywords | Est. CPC | Monthly volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SBA 7(a) loans** | `sba 7a loan`, `sba 7a loan requirements`, `sba 7a loan rates` | $10–$25 | 1,000–6,600 |
| **SBA 504 loans** | `sba 504 loan`, `sba 504 loan requirements`, `sba 504 commercial real estate` | $10–$28 | 260–5,400 |
| **SBA application** | `apply for sba loan`, `sba loan application`, `how to get sba loan` | $12–$35 | 2,400–8,100 |
| **SBA qualifications** | `sba loan requirements`, `how to qualify for sba loan`, `sba loan eligibility` | $8–$25 | 590–14,800 |
| **SBA rates/terms** | `sba loan rates`, `current sba loan rates`, `sba loan terms` | $8–$25 | 880–14,800 |

### Tier 2: High-value long-tail keywords (phrase match, budget-friendly)

These are your **highest-ROI keywords** — lower CPCs ($5–$15), strong commercial intent, and less competition. Allocate **60% of your budget here**.

| Keyword cluster | Top keywords | Est. CPC | Monthly volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Industry-specific** | `sba loan for restaurant`, `sba loan for trucking company`, `sba loan for construction business`, `sba loan for gas station`, `sba loan for franchise`, `sba loan for medical practice`, `sba loan for dental practice`, `sba loan for daycare`, `sba loan for hotel`, `sba loan for laundromat` | $6–$20 | 50–880 each |
| **Use-case specific** | `sba loan to buy a business`, `sba loan for business acquisition`, `sba loan for commercial real estate purchase`, `sba loan for partner buyout`, `sba loan for working capital` | $8–$30 | 100–2,400 |
| **Startup/new business** | `sba startup loan`, `sba loan for new business`, `sba loan for startup with no revenue`, `sba loan for franchise startup` | $6–$25 | 100–3,600 |
| **Amount-specific** | `sba loan $500k`, `sba loan $1 million`, `sba microloan`, `sba loan $250k` | $5–$18 | 50–2,400 |
| **Qualification queries** | `sba loan credit score requirements`, `sba loan with bad credit`, `do i qualify for sba loan`, `sba loan down payment requirements`, `how much sba loan can i get` | $6–$18 | 390–2,400 |
| **Refinancing** | `sba loan refinance`, `sba loan to refinance business debt`, `refinance commercial loan with sba` | $8–$25 | 50–1,000 |

### Tier 3: Broader business loan terms (exact match only, tight negatives)

Use sparingly to capture searchers who haven't yet discovered SBA as an option.

| Keyword | Est. CPC | Monthly volume | Risk level |
|---|---|---|---|
| `small business loan` | $15–$40 | 40,500–90,500 | High (budget drain) |
| `government business loans` | $8–$20 | 2,400–5,400 | Medium |
| `working capital loan` | $10–$25 | 2,400–5,400 | Medium |
| `business loan broker` | $10–$25 | 590–1,300 | Low (direct intent) |
| `equipment financing` | $10–$28 | 3,600–8,100 | Medium |

### Negative keyword list (add before launching)

This list is essential at this budget level. A single irrelevant click at $15 costs real money.

**Job/career terms:** jobs, careers, hiring, employment, salary, loan officer jobs, underwriter, glassdoor, indeed, resume, internship

**Government/disaster:** sba.gov, sba office, sba phone number, sba near me, sba disaster loan, sba eidl, ppp loan, paycheck protection, covid loan, sba grants, sba administrator

**Grants and free money:** grants, free money, free loans, grant application, stimulus, forgiveness, donation, no repayment, free business funding

**Wrong loan types:** personal loan, student loan, auto loan, car loan, mortgage, home loan, payday loan, credit card, home equity

**Informational/educational:** what is, definition, wikipedia, pdf, essay, research paper, history of, statistics, tutorial, course, explained, overview

**Negative intent:** scam, fraud, complaint, lawsuit, review, worst, avoid, denied, default, foreclosure, bankruptcy filing

**DIY/self-service:** template, sample, form download, free template, checklist, step by step guide

**International:** canada, uk, australia, india, europe, international, overseas

**Payments/existing loans:** make payment, pay sba loan, loan servicer, existing loan, lender login, lender portal

## 2. Ad copy that converts — headlines, descriptions, and angles

Google's Responsive Search Ads allow up to **15 headlines (30 characters each)** and **4 descriptions (90 characters each)**, displaying 3 headlines and 2 descriptions at a time. The key is providing diverse headline themes so Google can test winning combinations.

### The six headline themes every RSA needs

**Pin headline 1** to a keyword-matching headline for Quality Score. **Pin headline 3** to a CTA. Let Google rotate the rest.

**Theme 1 — Keyword match (pin to position 1):**
- `SBA 7(a) Loans — Up to $5M` (28 chars)
- `SBA Loans for Small Business` (29 chars)
- `SBA Business Loan Experts` (25 chars)
- `Get an SBA Loan — Fast` (22 chars)

**Theme 2 — Benefit/differentiator:**
- `Compare 50+ SBA Lenders` (24 chars)
- `One App, Multiple Lenders` (25 chars)
- `SBA Loans Made Simple` (21 chars)
- `Skip the Bank Runaround` (24 chars)

- `2,000+ Businesses Funded` (25 chars)

**Theme 4 — Rates/amounts:**
- `Rates From Prime + 2.75%` (24 chars)
- `SBA Loans Up to $5 Million` (26 chars)
- `Get $50K - $5M SBA Funding` (27 chars)
- `Low Monthly Payment SBA Loans` (30 chars)

**Theme 5 — Speed/ease:**
- `Fast SBA Loan Pre-Approval` (26 chars)
- `Get Pre-Qualified in Minutes` (28 chars)
- `SBA Loan - Apply in Minutes` (27 chars)
- `Streamlined SBA Loan Process` (29 chars)

**Theme 6 — CTA (pin to position 3):**
- `See If You Qualify - Free` (25 chars)
- `Get Your Free SBA Quote` (23 chars)
- `Check SBA Eligibility Now` (26 chars)
- `Talk to an SBA Expert` (22 chars)

### Description copy (90 characters each)

**Description 1 (value proposition):** `One simple application connects you with SBA preferred lenders. No bank visits required.` (89 chars)

**Description 2 (trust + CTA):** `Trusted by 2,000+ business owners. Free pre-qualification. No obligation. Apply online.` (89 chars)

**Description 3 (pain point):** `Tired of slow banks? Get pre-qualified for an SBA loan today. Fast decisions, less hassle.` (90 chars)

**Description 4 (specifics):** `SBA loans from $50K to $5M for working capital, real estate, equipment & debt refinancing.` (90 chars)

### CTAs ranked by conversion performance

Research shows these CTAs perform best for financial services leads, in order: **"See If You Qualify"** and **"Check Your Rate"** outperform all others because they're curiosity-driven and low-commitment. "Apply Now" works for bottom-funnel traffic only. "Get a Free Quote" and "Free Consultation" are strong mid-funnel options. Always pair CTAs with risk-reducers: "No hard credit pull," "No obligation," "Free."

### Industry-specific ad group copy

Create separate RSAs for industry-specific ad groups. Example for restaurants:

- Headline: `SBA Loans for Restaurants` (25 chars)
- Headline: `Fund Your Next Location` (23 chars)
- Description: `Restaurant owners: get SBA loans for expansion, equipment, or renovation. Quick decisions.` (90 chars)

### Essential ad extensions

Build these before launch — they increase CTR by **10–25%** on average:

- **Sitelinks:** "SBA 7(a) Loans," "Check Eligibility," "SBA Loan Calculator," "Client Reviews," "How SBA Loans Work," "Contact a Loan Advisor"
- **Callouts:** "No Upfront Fees," "Free Pre-Qualification," "SBA Preferred Lenders," "BBB A+ Rated," "Dedicated Loan Advisor," "Loans $50K to $5M"
- **Structured snippets:** Types: "SBA 7(a), SBA 504, Term Loans, Equipment Financing, Lines of Credit"
- **Call extension:** Phone number with "Speak to an SBA Loan Expert"

## 3. Landing page architecture that turns clicks into leads

At **$5–$15 per click**, your landing page conversion rate is the single biggest lever for campaign profitability. The difference between a 3% and 6% conversion rate literally doubles your lead volume without spending another dollar.

### Page structure (top to bottom)

**Hero section (above the fold):** A benefit-driven headline that mirrors the ad copy — e.g., "Get Matched With the SBA Lender Most Likely to Approve Your Business." Subheadline addresses the core pain point: "One application. 50+ preferred lenders. Expert guidance from start to close." Place a short-form CTA or the first step of a multi-step form here. Add a trust bar immediately below with BBB rating, number of businesses funded, and star rating.

**How It Works section (3 steps):** Step 1: "Tell Us About Your Business" (2-minute form). Step 2: "Get Matched With SBA Preferred Lenders." Step 3: "Receive Your Funding." This reduces anxiety around the notoriously complex SBA application process.

**Benefits section:** Bullet the key advantages — up to $5M in SBA-backed funding, competitive rates (Prime + 2.25%–2.75%), terms up to 25 years, lower down payments, access to 50+ lenders through one application, no prepayment penalties.

**Social proof section:** Client testimonials with **real names, businesses, specific loan amounts, and industries**. Aggregate stats ("$100M+ in SBA loans closed"). Google review widget showing 4.5+ stars. Lender partner logos. "As Featured In" media logos if available.

**Comparison table — "Going Direct vs. Working With Us":** This is a critical section for a brokerage. Direct: 1 lender, 1 set of criteria, 90–180 day timeline, you navigate alone. With Us: 50+ lenders, expert matching, 45–60 days, dedicated advisor handles everything.

**FAQ section:** Address the top objections: What credit score do I need? How long does it take? What documents are required? What if I don't qualify for SBA? (This is where the down-sell path begins.)

**Secondary CTA:** Repeat the form or CTA button for users who scrolled past the hero.

**Footer with required disclosures:** Physical address, broker disclosure, privacy policy, terms of service.

### The multi-step form is non-negotiable

Research consistently shows multi-step forms outperform single-step forms by **50–300%** for financial services. One case study documented conversion rates jumping from **11% to 46%** after switching to a multi-step format.

**Recommended 3-step form:**

- **Step 1 (low friction):** Loan amount needed (dropdown slider), loan purpose (dropdown: Working Capital, Real Estate, Equipment, Business Acquisition, Expansion, Refinancing), time in business (dropdown)
- **Step 2 (qualification):** Estimated annual revenue (dropdown ranges), estimated credit score range (Excellent 720+, Good 680–719, Fair 620–679, Below 620), industry (dropdown), state
- **Step 3 (contact):** Full name, email, phone, consent checkbox

Start with the easiest questions to build commitment. Use dropdowns and click-to-select buttons instead of text fields. Show a progress bar. Label the submit button with benefit-oriented text — **"See My Options"** not "Submit." Add "Takes less than 2 minutes" and a security badge near the form.

### Trust signals ranked by conversion impact

**BBB accreditation** is the single most powerful trust signal in financial services landing pages. Follow with: customer testimonials with specifics, Google/Trustpilot review widgets, aggregate social proof ("10,000+ businesses helped"), lender partner logos, security badges (SSL, 256-bit encryption), team/advisor photos, and years in business. **Do not use the SBA web icon or logo** — this is reserved exclusively for SBA-approved lenders, not brokers.

### Critical copy distinction for brokers

Never write "We offer SBA loans" or "Our SBA loans." Always write **"We connect you with SBA Preferred Lenders"** or "We help you find the right SBA lender." Position yourself as "Business Funding Advisors" or "SBA Loan Specialists" — the word "broker" carries negative connotation in consumer contexts.

## 4. Messaging strategy — what actually moves small business owners to act

### The pain points that drive SBA loan searches

The **#1 frustration** among SBA loan seekers is **complexity and paperwork overload**. Federal Reserve data shows businesses spend an average of **24 hours** just researching and applying for credit. The SBA process requires personal financial statements, business plans, tax returns, P&L statements, and SBA-specific forms — and most business owners have no idea how to navigate it.

**Slow processing** ranks second. Traditional SBA lenders take **3–6 months** to close. **High denial rates** rank third — the 2025 Fed Small Business Credit Survey found only **32% of SBA loan applicants were fully approved**, leaving 68% denied or partially approved. Confusing eligibility requirements, personal guarantee fears, and difficulty finding the right lender round out the top concerns.

### Lead with simplicity, not rates

Per Academy Bank's 2025 survey of 220+ entrepreneurs, what matters most to small business borrowers is:

1. **Easy application process** — 56.9% (top priority)
2. **Competitive interest rates** — 54.1%
3. **Personal relationships/guidance** — 50%+
4. **Speed of funding**
5. **Transparency** — no hidden fees

This data reveals a critical insight: **simplicity and expert guidance beat rate shopping as the primary motivator.** Your messaging hierarchy should be: "We handle the entire SBA process for you" → "SBA funding in as little as 45 days" → "Access to 50+ preferred lenders = higher approval chances" → "Lowest SBA rates — we shop the market for you."

### Emotional triggers outperform rational ones

Research shows emotional factors influence **70% of B2B financial decisions**. Lead with emotional hooks — relief from paperwork anxiety, confidence from expert guidance, fear-of-rejection reduction — then support with rational proof (rates, terms, approval stats). The PAS framework (Problem-Agitate-Solution) works consistently: Problem: "The SBA process is confusing and time-consuming." Agitate: "One wrong move means denial and months wasted." Solution: "Our specialists handle everything and match you to the right lender."

### Broker positioning — reframe "direct" as the risky choice

The core objection every broker faces is "why wouldn't I just go to a bank?" The counter-narrative: **going direct is actually the risky choice.** Each SBA lender has different internal credit policies, industry preferences, and approval criteria. Applying to the wrong one wastes months and results in a denial that can't be undone.

Effective framing: "Banks only offer their own products. We shop 50+ lenders to find your best deal." Or: "Applied at a bank and got denied? That was ONE bank. We work with dozens." Include the stat: "Only 32% of SBA applicants get fully approved at their first bank. Our clients see approval rates of [X]% because we match them to the right lender from the start."

### The down-sell funnel — turning SBA denials into alternative financing revenue

With **68% of SBA applicants** not fully approved, the alternative financing products (MCA, term loans, equipment financing) represent enormous revenue potential. The key is framing alternatives positively.

**Never say:** "You didn't qualify for SBA, but here's what we can do." **Always say:** "Based on your business profile, here's the smartest funding option to meet your timeline and goals."

Frame each product for its genuine advantages: Term loans offer "fast, affordable business growth capital." Equipment financing lets you "get the equipment now, pay from the revenue it generates." Lines of credit provide "flexible capital on demand — only pay for what you use." Revenue-based funding (MCA) delivers "fast capital with flexible payments tied to your sales."

The recommended primary messaging framework: **"We help small businesses find the best funding — starting with SBA loans with the lowest rates, all the way to fast working capital solutions."** This positions the full product suite as a strength rather than revealing the down-sell mechanism.

### Industry-specific messaging angles

| Industry | Pain point hook | SBA appeal | Ad angle |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Restaurants** | Tight margins, equipment costs, expansion capital | #1 industry for SBA 7(a) by volume | "Fund your next location with SBA" |
| **Trucking** | Fleet acquisition, fuel costs, 30–45 day payment terms | Equipment financing critical | "Expand your fleet without draining cash" |
| **Construction** | Project-based cash flow, equipment, bonding | SBA CAPLines for working capital | "Bid on bigger jobs with SBA funding" |
| **Medical/dental** | Practice acquisition, expensive equipment, reimbursement cycles | Strong cash flow businesses favored by lenders | "Buy your own practice with SBA" |
| **Franchises** | High startup costs, franchisor requirements | SBA 7(a) is the go-to for franchise funding | "SBA franchise financing made easy" |

## 5. Campaign structure for maximum Quality Score and data efficiency

### Architecture: 2 campaigns, 5–7 ad groups

At $4,000/month (~$133/day), campaign consolidation is critical. Spreading budget across too many campaigns starves Google's algorithm of learning data. The consensus among PPC experts in 2025–2026 is that **Single Theme Ad Groups (STAGs)** — grouping 5–15 tightly related keywords per ad group — have replaced Single Keyword Ad Groups (SKAGs) as the optimal structure. STAGs consolidate data faster, improve machine learning signals, and work better with Responsive Search Ads.

**Campaign 1: SBA Loans (Primary) — $3,200–$3,600/month (80–90%)**

| Ad group | Keywords (5–15 each) | Match type | Budget share |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SBA Loans General** | `sba loan`, `sba loans for small business`, `sba loan application`, `apply for sba loan` | Exact | 25% |
| **SBA 7(a) Loans** | `sba 7a loan`, `sba 7a loan requirements`, `sba 7(a) loan rates`, `7a loan for business` | Exact + Phrase | 20% |
| **SBA 504 Loans** | `sba 504 loan`, `sba 504 program`, `sba 504 real estate`, `504 loan requirements` | Exact + Phrase | 10% |
| **SBA Qualifications** | `sba loan requirements`, `do i qualify for sba loan`, `sba loan eligibility`, `sba loan credit score` | Phrase | 15% |
| **Industry-Specific SBA** | `sba loan for restaurant`, `sba loan for trucking`, `sba loan for franchise`, `sba loan for medical practice` | Phrase | 20% |
| **SBA Startup/Acquisition** | `sba startup loan`, `sba loan to buy a business`, `business acquisition loan sba` | Phrase | 10% |

**Campaign 2: Alternative Financing — $400–$800/month (10–20%)**

| Ad group | Keywords | Match type |
|---|---|---|
| **Business Loan General** | `small business loan`, `business financing`, `working capital loan` | Exact only |
| **Equipment Financing** | `equipment financing`, `equipment loan business` | Phrase |
| **Fast/Alternative Funding** | `fast business loan`, `business funding fast approval` | Phrase |

### Match type strategy by phase

**Month 1:** Start with **70% exact match, 30% phrase match**. This controls spend while you learn which keywords convert. Never use broad match without conversion data.

**Month 2+:** After accumulating 30+ conversions, add **broad match** on your top-performing keyword themes paired with Smart Bidding. Google data shows advertisers switching from exact to broad match with Target CPA see ~35% more conversions — but only with sufficient conversion history.

**Ongoing:** Review the Search Terms Report **weekly** for the first 3 months. Add negatives aggressively. Graduate winning search terms from phrase match to exact match.

### Campaign settings

- **Network:** Search Network only. **Uncheck** Display Network and Search Partners — both waste budget for financial services
- **Location:** USA, "People IN or regularly IN your targeted locations" (not "interested in" — prevents international clicks)
- **Ad schedule:** Start 24/7, then restrict to **Monday–Friday 7AM–8PM EST** after collecting data (covers all US time zones during business hours)
- **Devices:** All initially. After 2 weeks, apply **-15% to -25% mobile bid adjustment** — financial services converts better on desktop due to longer forms

---

## 6. Bidding strategy and budget allocation — a phased approach

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2): Manual CPC — data collection

Start with **Manual CPC** with Enhanced CPC optional. Set max CPC bids at **$8–$12 for core SBA terms** and **$5–$8 for long-tail keywords**. This gives you full cost control during the critical data-gathering phase. At ~$133/day, expect roughly **13–26 clicks per day**. Monitor daily.

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3–6): Maximize Clicks → Maximize Conversions

After establishing baseline data, shift to **Maximize Clicks** with a $10–$12 CPC cap to gather conversion data faster. Once you hit **15–30 conversions within a 30-day window**, switch to **Maximize Conversions**. This is the consensus threshold from Google, KlientBoost, and multiple PPC experts — Smart Bidding below this threshold optimizes blindly and wastes budget.

### Phase 3 (Month 2+): Target CPA

With 30+ conversions, transition to **Target CPA**. Set your initial target at **10–15% above your observed actual CPA**, then lower it by 5–10% every two weeks. Your daily budget should be at least 2x your Target CPA for the algorithm to function properly.

### Lead volume and ROI projections

| Scenario | Avg CPC | Clicks/month | Conv. rate | Leads/month | Cost/lead |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Conservative (Month 1)** | $10 | 400 | 3% | 12 | $333 |
| **Moderate (Month 2)** | $7 | 571 | 4% | 23 | $174 |
| **Optimistic (Month 3+)** | $6 | 667 | 5.5% | 37 | $108 |

**Realistic steady-state expectation: 20–35 leads per month** at $115–$200 cost per lead after optimization. Even at the conservative end, the unit economics are compelling: if broker commission averages **$7,500 per funded SBA deal** and 8% of leads close, that's roughly 2 funded deals per month = **$15,000 revenue from $4,000 in ad spend** — a 3.75x ROAS.

### Budget optimization tactics

**Ad scheduling:** Business loan searches peak **Monday–Friday, 8AM–6PM local time**. After collecting 2–4 weeks of data, apply +15–25% bid adjustments during peak converting hours and -30% to -50% for overnight.

**Geographic adjustments:** Start targeting all 50 states equally, then after 30 days apply +10–20% bid adjustments for business-dense states (CA, TX, NY, FL, IL) and -20–30% for underperforming regions.

**Audience layering:** Add In-Market audiences ("Business Loans," "Small Business Services") and Affinity audiences ("Business Professionals," "Small Business Owners") in **Observation mode** — this collects data without restricting reach. After 30 days, apply +20–40% bid adjustments on high-performing audiences.

## 7. Competitor landscape and exploitable gaps

### Who you're competing against

The SBA loan advertising space is dominated by three tiers of competitors. **Tier 1 (massive budgets, $100K+/month):** Lendio, Biz2Credit, NerdWallet/Fundera, and Kabbage (AmEx) — these marketplaces and content platforms dominate broad keywords. **Tier 2 (moderate budgets, $20K–$50K/month):** SmartBiz, Live Oak Bank, Celtic Bank, Funding Circle — these are direct lenders or tech-enabled lending platforms. **Tier 3 (smaller operators, $5K–$30K/month):** United Capital Source, Clarify Capital, National Funding — brokers and smaller lenders.

You cannot outspend Tier 1. But you can **outmaneuver** all three tiers by exploiting these gaps:

### Seven gaps a broker can exploit

**Gap 1 — Industry-specific targeting.** Almost no competitors run dedicated industry-specific ad groups. Live Oak Bank does some, but most major players use generic messaging. A broker running dedicated campaigns for restaurants, trucking, construction, medical practices, and franchises — with tailored ad copy and landing pages — captures highly qualified traffic at lower CPCs.

**Gap 2 — The "denied applicant" audience.** With 68% of SBA applicants denied or partially approved, there's a massive frustrated audience. Very few competitors address them directly. Ads like "Bank Said No? We Have Options" and "Denied an SBA Loan? Don't Let 1 Bank Decide" capture this high-intent, underserved segment.

**Gap 3 — Speed differentiation.** SBA loans are notoriously slow at traditional banks (3–6 months). If your preferred lender relationships enable 45–60 day closings, "SBA Loan in Weeks, Not Months" is a powerful differentiator that few competitors claim.

**Gap 4 — The one-stop funding shop.** No competitors clearly message the safety net of alternative financing alongside SBA. "SBA First. Alternatives If Needed." positions the broker as a comprehensive solution and captures the full market — not just the 32% who qualify.

**Gap 5 — Human touch vs. tech-only.** Companies like SmartBiz and Biz2Credit lean heavily on AI/tech messaging. A broker can differentiate with "Work With a Real Person" and "Dedicated Funding Advisor From Start to Close" — which resonates with the 50%+ of borrowers who prefer personal relationships.

**Gap 6 — Comparison and education content.** Few competitors run ads to comparison content. "SBA vs. Term Loan — Which Is Right for You?" captures mid-funnel researchers at lower CPCs.

**Gap 7 — Specific use-case targeting.** Keywords like "SBA loan for business acquisition," "SBA loan for partner buyout," and "SBA loan for debt consolidation" carry strong intent but low competition. Most competitors don't bother with these long-tail terms.

## 8. Compliance — what gets ads disapproved and what gets you sued

### Google Ads policy requirements

**Business loans (including SBA) are excluded from Google's "Personal Loans" policy**, meaning the strict APR disclosure rules for personal loans do not apply. However, the general **Financial Products & Services policy** requires your landing page to display a **physical business address** (clearly visible, not hidden behind a link), **all associated fees** disclosed (broker fees, origination fees), and **links to third-party accreditation** where claimed (e.g., if displaying a BBB badge, link to your BBB profile).

Google also requires **Financial Services Verification** — you must complete identity verification and industry-specific certification proving appropriate licenses. Additionally, **personalized advertising restrictions** prohibit targeting financial product ads by gender, age, parental status, marital status, or ZIP code (city, metro, state, and radius targeting are fine).

**Critical for the MCA down-sell:** Google prohibits advertising any loan products with **APR above 36%** in the US. Many MCA and alternative financing products carry effective APRs exceeding this threshold. Be extremely cautious about how alternative financing pricing is represented in any ads or landing pages that Google will review.

### SBA-specific rules for brokers

As a broker, you **cannot** use the SBA web icon or logo on your website (reserved for SBA-approved lenders who have signed SBA Form 750), claim to be an "SBA lender" or "SBA Preferred Lender," or imply SBA endorsement. You **can** say you "connect businesses with SBA Preferred Lenders," reference SBA programs by name, describe SBA loan features as general information, and list your lender partners with their permission. Include a clear disclaimer: **"Not affiliated with the U.S. Small Business Administration or any government agency."**

### FTC and state requirements

The FTC requires clear disclosure that **you are a broker, not a lender**. The FCC's 2024 one-to-one consent rule means each lender who will contact the lead must be identified in the consent form — no more blanket "marketing partners" language. TCPA requires express written consent before calling or texting.

**State commercial financing disclosure laws** now apply in eight states: California, New York, Florida, Georgia, Connecticut, Kansas, Utah, and Virginia. These require TILA-like disclosures (APR, finance charges, total payments) for commercial financing under $500K–$2.5M depending on the state. Banks are generally exempt, but **non-bank brokers are covered**. Given USA-wide targeting, ensure compliance with all eight states' requirements.

### Landing page disclosure checklist

Every landing page must include: physical business address (full street address), broker disclosure statement ("We are a business funding brokerage, not a direct lender"), fee disclosure, data use disclosure with specific consent language identifying who will contact the applicant, privacy policy and terms of service links, SSL security, "Not affiliated with the U.S. Small Business Administration" disclaimer, and an equal opportunity statement. State licensing numbers (especially for CA, NY, FL) and NMLS number should also be displayed if applicable.

## Conclusion — the three moves that matter most

The biggest insight from this research isn't about keywords or bidding — it's about positioning. **The SBA loan advertising market is dominated by generic messaging from well-funded competitors who all say the same thing.** A broker with a $4,000 budget cannot win by playing their game. The winning strategy has three pillars.

**First, go narrow on keywords.** Concentrate 60%+ of spend on industry-specific and use-case-specific long-tail terms where CPCs are $5–$15 instead of $15–$40. You'll reach fewer people but convert them at dramatically higher rates because the ad, landing page, and messaging speak directly to their situation.

**Second, own the "full solution" narrative.** No major competitor positions themselves as "SBA first, alternatives if needed." This messaging captures the entire market — the 32% who qualify for SBA and the 68% who don't — while competitors lose the non-qualifying majority. Build the multi-step form to quietly qualify leads for the right product while the applicant simply believes they're exploring their options.

**Third, win on speed-to-lead, not spend.** In business lending, the first company to respond wins 50%+ of the time. Set up instant lead notifications, call within 5 minutes, and use the thank you page to set expectations ("One of our SBA specialists will call you within 10 minutes"). This operational advantage costs nothing and outweighs any amount of ad spend optimization. At 20–35 leads per month and a realistic 5–10% close rate, this campaign structure should yield **1–3 funded SBA deals monthly** — generating $5,000–$45,000 in revenue from a $4,000 investment.
